ASIC for Microcontroller Memory Testing

Hardware-Based Hamming (7,4) Error Correction Auditor

This repository contains the design and implementation of an ASIC Auditor designed to monitor the data integrity of microcontrollers and memory systems in real-time. The project follows a complete industry-standard ASIC design flow using 180nm CMOS technology.

📋 Project Overview

Microcontrollers in high-reliability environments (automotive, aerospace, medical) are susceptible to bit-flip errors caused by electrical noise or radiation. 

This project implements a dedicated hardware auditor that:

1.Generates protected (7,4) Hamming codes from 4-bit data.
2.Audits received data from a Microcontroller (MC).
3.Identifies the exact bit-position of any single-bit error using syndrome decoding.


🛠️ Technical Specifications

.Technology Node: SCL 180nm CMOS
.Algorithm: Hamming (7,4) Error Correction Code (ECC)
.Clock Frequency: 100 MHz (10ns Period)
.Total Die Area: 33,531 μm²
.Power Consumption: 2.497 mW
.Total Cell Count: 60
.Timing Slack: +2.015 ns (MET)


🏗️ Design Architecture
The design is partitioned into three main Verilog modules:

1. Parity Generator (p_gen.v)
.Input: 4-bit raw data.
.Output: 7-bit Hamming code.
.Feature: Raises a ready flag once the code is calculated and stable.
2. Parity Checker (p_check.v)
.Input: 7-bit Hamming code (received from MCU).
.Output: 3-bit Error Syndrome.
.Feature: Identifies the bit index (1-7) where a fault occurred.
3. Top-Level / Pad Wrapper (parity_main.v)
An optimized 1-bit State Machine manages the operational flow, integrated with physical I/O pads:

.GEN (0): Active encoding of data.
.CHECK (1): Active auditing of MCU response.


🚀 ASIC Design Flow
The project was executed using the Cadence Digital Design Suite:

1.Functional Simulation: Verified logic correctness using Xcelium.
2.Logic Synthesis: Converted RTL to a gate-level netlist using Genus Synthesis Solution.
3.Floorplanning: Defined a die area with a 49-pad I/O ring (25 I/O, 20 Power, 4 Corner).
4.Power Planning: Implemented VDD/VSS rings and stripes for stable power distribution.
5.Placement: Optimized cell locations to minimize wire length.
6.Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS): Synchronized internal flip-flops with minimal skew.
7.Routing: Completed global and detailed routing of all signal nets.
8.Signoff: Verified timing, area, and power reports.


📊 Physical Design Details

A unique feature of this ASIC is its Pad-Limited nature. To maintain a near-square aspect ratio, a custom pad distribution was calculated:

.3 Sides: 11 pads each (60μm spacing).
.1 Side: 12 pads (50μm spacing).
.Total Perimeter: Integrated 49 physical pads to allow real-world interfacing with external hardware.
